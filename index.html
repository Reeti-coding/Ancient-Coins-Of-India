<h1> Punch-marked coins  </h1>

<p> The most conventional system of coinage emerged with the circulation of punch-marked coins, that were mostly made of silver, and sometimes even copper. They were sometimes square, or round but mostly rectangular in shape.
The symbols on these were hammered using punches and dies. That is why we know them as punch-marked coins.
A standard punch-marked coin often weighed around 32 rattis or about 52 grains (1 grain = 64.79 mg).
Punch marked coins are found across the subcontinent and were popular till the early centuries CE.
The Punch marked coin series can be further divided into four categories: The Taxila-Gandhara type, the Kosala type, the Avanti type, and the Magadhan type.
With the expansion of the Magadhan Empire, the coins that belonged to the Magadhan category replaced the other three types. It must be noted that these coins do not have any legends inscribed on them which could convey the details of the kingdom.

<p>
The Mauryan Empire used the punch-marked coins but with royal standard to make sure of their authenticity.
The liberty to use two different metals for coins was granted, and hence coins in silver and copper were very popular.

<p>
The next prominent range of coins that were issued belongs to 2nd/1st century BCE by the Indo-Greeks. The Indo-Greeks system of coinage becomes significant because the minting was executed in a more refined manner.
The coins were mostly made of silver, usually round, with exceptions to few rectangular or circular) bore the name of the issuing ruler along with depicting legends.
For example, the coins of Menander and Strabo I show them passing through different stages of life, suggesting their long reigns.
The languages on these coins was Prakrit, inscribed mostly in Kharoshthi script.

<p>
The Kushanas (1st-4th Centuries CE) were the first dynasty in the subcontinent that issued a large number of gold coins. The lower denomination was usually found in copper coins.
The coins usually bore the figure, name, and title of the ruler on the obverse and the deities on the reverse. The legends are either entirely in Greek, or in some cases in Kharoshthi on the reverse.

<p>The Imperial Guptas issued well-minted and well-executed gold coins, die struck with various impressive legends in Sanskrit. These coins, also known as dinaras, were mostly found in North India.
The obverse has the kings in various poses, mostly in martial mood, but sometimes even in artistic calibre.
Coins have also shown rulers like Samudragupta and Kumaragupta playing Vina.
The Gupta coins were issued in gold in large numbers and have been credited to their fine aesthetic appeal. However, the purity of gold saw a decline during the later Guptas.

<p>The dynasties like the Gurjaras, Pratiharas, Chalukyas, Paramaras, and the Palas from circa 530 CE to 1202 CE can be put under a broad category of Indo-Sassanian styled coinage.
The main features of these coins included the bust of the ruling sovereign in a simplified geometric style on the obverse and a motif like a fire altar on the reverse.

<h1> Coinage by the Imperial Cholas </h1>

<p>
The coinage of the imperial Cholas bore semblance to the South Indian dynastic coins. The Chola coins exhibited a tiger crest. They also suggested political developments.
The emblems like fish and bow which belonged to the Pandyas and Cheras suggested a political conquest of these political powers, and also the idea of co-existence.
